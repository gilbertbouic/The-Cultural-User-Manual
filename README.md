## 💡 Integration Principles

Key principles for effective cultural integration:

1. **Representative nations illustrate patterns** — but individual countries and regions within groupings maintain unique characteristics
2. **Local research is essential** — always investigate specific local customs and expectations
3. **Individuals vary** — cultural patterns describe tendencies, not rules that apply to everyone
4. **Respect and curiosity** — approaching differences with genuine interest facilitates connection
5. **Adaptation takes time** — cultural integration is a gradual process of observation, learning, and adjustment
